# What is Clojure?

Clojure is a general purpose programming language and is used for creating any applications, tools, services across any industry.

Clojure is a hosted language, so it can run on a Java Virtual machine (especially for high volume data processing).  Clojure can also run on JavaScript engines found in web browsers and nodejs.

Clojure has a very simple syntax and is simple to write and maintain.

Clojure is very data centric and the standard library has over 500 functions for manipulating and transforming data, so is ideal for data science tasks.
