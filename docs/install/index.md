# Install

Clojure CLI is used to run Clojure code and is extended by a wide range of community tools.

A [Clojure aware editor](https://practical.li/clojure/clojure-editors/) is highly recommended.  Practicalli uses the following

- [Spacemacs](https://practical.li/spacemacs/) - an extensive and easy to use Emacs configuration
- [Neovim and Conjure](https://practical.li/neovim/) - a lightweight and highly extensible modal editing experience
- [Doom Emacs](https://practical.li/doom-emacs/) - a minimal Emacs configuration that is easily configurable

Practialli Clojure provides [an overview of Clojure editors available](https://practical.li/clojure/clojure-editors/)

Clojure CLI provide a simple and configurable way to:

* Run Clojure programs and tools
* Run an interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) and evaluate Clojure expressions, usually with a [Clojure aware editor](https://practical.li/clojure/clojure-editors/)
* Managing dependencies (via tools.deps) from Maven and Git repositories

Using community tools on top of Clojure CLI tools provides tasks to create, develop, build and deploy Clojure applications and services

Follow the [Practicalli Clojure Install Guide](https://practical.li/clojure/install/) to install Clojure and supporting tools.
