# Practicalli Clojure Data Science

![Practicalli Data Science book banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/practicalli/graphic-design/live/book-covers/practicalli-clojure-data-science-book-banner-alpha.png)

!!! WARNING "Alpha stage book"
    Currently the book is a collection of various external references with a small amount of commercial experience captured.


A practical guide to data mining, data transformation and visualisation tools, techniques and libraries.  Guides will take a story telling approach to ensure a meaningful context in which design decisions are taken.

A starting point for Clojure developers on their journey into Data Science.  As Data Science is such a vast subject area, no one resource can cover such diversity, so this guide will recommend numerous resources that go far deeper into specific areas.


## Data Mining

* scraping unstructured data sources
* consuming open API data sources
* highlighting reputable and high quality data sources


## Data Transformation

* writing services and applications in the context of data science.


## Story telling with data

- Visualisation of data


## Data Science theory

- Statistics and probability
- Linear Algebra
- Mathematical Optimisation
- Calculus


## Integration with data science tools

- [:fontawesome-brands-github: libpython-clj](https://github.com/clj-python/libpython-clj){target=_blank} - Deep Clojure/Python Integration
- [:fontawesome-brands-youtube: Extending Clojure with Python - Chris Nuernberger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQPW16_jixs){target=_blank}

## Aspects to develop for the book

* Aspects of data science and
* Visualization of data
* Integration with other data science tooling
* Reference to useful mathematical techniques

This guide will not teach you how to be a professional data scientist but should help you when working with experienced data scientists.
