![Practicalli Data Science book banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/practicalli/graphic-design/live/book-covers/practicalli-clojure-data-science-book-banner-alpha.png)

!!! WARNING "Alpha stage book"
    Currently the book is a collection of various external references with a small amount of commercial experience captured.


A guide to writing Clojure services and using tools to support a range of data science activities.

Topics will include data mining, data transformation and visualisation tools, techniques and libraries.  Guides will take a story telling approach using visualisation tools to ensure a meaningful context in which design decisions are taken.

!!! QUOTE ""
    Without good data, there is no science - John Stevenson


Data Science is a vast subject area so this guide will recommend numerous resources that go deeper into specific areas.

> This guide does not claim to make any attempt to teach you how to be a professional data scientist.
