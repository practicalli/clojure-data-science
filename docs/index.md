# Practicalli Clojure Data Science

![Practicalli Data Science book banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/practicalli/graphic-design/live/book-covers/practicalli-clojure-data-science-book-banner-alpha.png)

!!! WARNING "Alpha stage book"
    Currently the book is a collection of various external references with a small amount of commercial experience captured.


A guide to writing services and applications in the context of data science

Topics will include data mining, data transformation and visualisation tools, techniques and libraries.  Guides will take a story telling approach using visualisation tools to ensure a meaningful context in which design decisions are taken.

A starting point for Clojure developers on their journey into Data Science.  As Data Science is such a vast subject area, no one resource can cover such diversity, so this guide will recommend numerous resources that go far deeper into specific areas.

This guide does not claim to make any attempt to teach you how to be a professional data scientist.


## Data Mining

* scraping unstructured data sources
* consuming open API data sources
* highlighting reputable and high quality data sources


## Data Transformation

* writing services and applications in the context of data science.


## Story telling with data

- Visualisation of data


## Data Science theory

- Statistics and probability
- Linear Algebra
- Mathematical Optimisation
- Calculus

Future topics

- Trend analysis
- Principle component analysis
- Basic Modelling (for machine learning)
- Time series [tidyverts](https://tidyverts.org/)
- Data generation - examples of how to generate sample data
- Data sources - what are good data sources and what concepts are they good for exploring
- Identify and simply explain data science concepts and provide understanding / examples of how they can be valuable


## Clojure libraries for data science

* Tablecloth
* dtype-next
* tech.viz
* Oz
* Hanami


## Integration with data science tools

- [:fontawesome-brands-github: libpython-clj](https://github.com/clj-python/libpython-clj){target=_blank} - Deep Clojure/Python Integration
- [:fontawesome-brands-youtube: Extending Clojure with Python - Chris Nuernberger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQPW16_jixs){target=_blank}


## Example projects

* Simple Covid19 dashboard - import data from CSV, simple data wrangling and creating a website dashboard using Oz for a vega-lite based visualisation and CSS for highlighting specific data points

* Oz Visualisation examples - learn some of the capabilities of Oz and demonstrate how to create a range of visualisations

* Ascii visualisation

* Visualising survey data - take a survey such as
