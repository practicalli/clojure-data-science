# Practicalli Clojure Data Science

![Practicalli Data Science book banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/practicalli/graphic-design/live/book-covers/practicalli-clojure-data-science-book-banner-alpha.png)

!!! WARNING "Alpha stage book"
    Currently the book is a collection of various external references with a small amount of commercial experience captured.


A guide to writing Clojure services and using tools to support a range of data science activities.

Topics will include data mining, data transformation and visualisation tools, techniques and libraries.  Guides will take a story telling approach using visualisation tools to ensure a meaningful context in which design decisions are taken.

Data Science is a vast subject area so this guide will recommend numerous resources that go deeper into specific areas.

!!! QUOTE "John Stevenson, Practicalli"
    Without good data, there is no science


## Data Engineering

Data Science relies on effecive data engineering workflow

![Data Engineering workflow - aquire generate clean explore transform](https://github.com/practicalli/graphic-design/blob/live/data-science/data-workflow-aquire-clean-explore-transform.png?raw=true){loading=lazy}


!!! HINT "Dont skimp on the data"
    Effecive models require a good history of data to work with and evolve the capabilities of a model.

    If there is data to collect, then it should be collected by default and only dropped if proved to be of no value over (a long period of) time.

    Not capturing data from the ealiest possible time can greatly limit or at least delay the creation of more effective models.
