# Persona

Persona help identify commonality of experience and approaches for people in the realm of data science and software engineering.


## Jane - mid-level Clojure developer

Jane is a Clojure developer with a couple of years commercial experience
Jane has no data science experience
She has a project to create a dashboard to visualise covid19 data for her company
And has to find useful tools and data sources to build the dashboard

An expanded version of the Jane Clojure developer persona:

Jane is a Clojure developer with a couple of years commercial experience and a year prior to that as a hobby
Jane has no data science experience but has seen TED talks and tutorials on visualising data
Jane has a project to create a dashboard to visualise covid19 data for her company
And has to find useful tools and data sources to build the dashboard
Jane visits the Government website for the country she resides in and finds various data sets in JSON and CSV formats
Jane choose to use Clojure CLI tools for the Clojure project to make use of the community tooling that helps visualise data as she is transforming it (Portal, Reveal)
Jane uses Spacemacs (Emacs / Cider) as its is a tool she is familiar with and Cider has simple to use debug and data inspector tools. Jane started with LightTable but that project is no longer active. She has also tried VS Code and Calva, but Cider is more stable and mature, has more features and better structural editing support.
The data wrangling libraries Jane is considering are clojure.data.json and clojure.data.csv as they are already included in Clojure
Jane has heard of other libraries for manipulating data, but doesnt know if they are relevant or easy to use
Jane will try using Oz for visualisations as she likes the idea of Vega & Vega lite as a data language, because it reminds her of the approach taken with Clojure itself.


## Jada - experienced data scientist
Jada
- statisticians
- machine learning
- visualisation
- computer vision
- ML Ops
- Probabilistic ???



Jamie is a analyst using data science for the last year as a company doing X
and has completed X data science course
and works with several more experienced data scientist who are using some python and R to build data models.


Jenny is new to coding and has an interest in data science and machine learning and has no real experience in any of these.
doesnt know what she doesnt know
doesnt know where to start looking


Jennifer has several years experience of R and Python (and occasionally wrangled a few C++ libraries)
Jennifer is curious about Clojure because ???
- listened to a talk on Simple made Easy and wishes that R and Python would make some of the work simpler
