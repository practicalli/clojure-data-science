> #### Hint::Alpha stage book
> Over 3 months of work has been planned out for the development of this book.  If funding via Clojurists Together is secured, then this work will be completed before the end of 2021.  Otherwise the first release of the book will be Spring/Summer 2022

A practical guide to data mining, data wrangling and visualisation tools, techniques and libraries.  Guides will take a story telling approach to ensure a meaningful context in which design decisions are taken.

A starting point for Clojure developers on their journey into Data Science.  As Data Science is such a vast subject area, no one resource can cover such diversity, so this guide will recommend numerous resources that go far deeper into specific areas.


## Target Audience

This guide is aimed at software engineers interested in data science or working as data analysts or with data science teams.  No data science experience is expected and the authors of this guide are not data science experts.

Mathematics concepts underpin much of data science and will be explained as they are used, or recommend resources linked to.  Mathematics experience should also notbe required.

## Aspects to develop for the book
* Aspects of data science and
* Visualization of data
* Integration with other data science tooling
* Reference to useful mathematical techniques

This guide will not teach you how to be a professional data scientist but should help you when working with experienced data scientists.
