# Data Science with Clojure
A guide to writing services and applications in the context of data science

Introduces libraries and tools useful for creating those applications

Visualisation of data

Integration with other data science tooling

Reference to useful mathematical techniques

This guide does not claim to make any attempt to teach you how to be a professional data scientist.


## Initial focus
Focusing on the essentials as a very basic introduction to some of the most simplest data science

* tools
* data wrangling
* data visualisation


## Example projects

* Simple Covid19 dashboard - import data from CSV, simple data wrangling and creating a website dashboard using Oz for a vega-lite based visualisation and CSS for highlighting specific data points

* Oz Visualisation examples - learn some of the capabilities of Oz and demonstrate how to create a range of visualisations

* Ascii visualisation

* Visualising survey data - take a survey such as


## Other aspects

* Data generation - examples of how to generate sample data

* Data sources - what are good data sources and what concepts are they good for exploring

* Identify and simply explain data science concepts and provide understanding / examples of how they can be valuable


## Data Science

What does it include and what kind of projects


- Trend analysis
- Principle component analysis
- Basic Modelling (for machine learning)



## Target Audience

This guide is aimed at predominantly software engineer (software developer) audience and they would benefit from Clojure experience and practice.

As little as possible experience should be required to follow and understand this guide


### Persona

Jane is a Clojure developer with a couple of years commercial experience
Jane has no data science experience
She has a project to create a dashboard to visualise covid19 data for her company
And has to find useful tools and data sources to build the dashboard

Jada
- statisticians
- machine learning
- visualisation
- computer vision
- ML Ops
- Probabilistic ???



Jamie is a analyst using data science for the last year as a company doing X
and has completed X data science course
and works with several more experienced data scientist who are using some python and R to build data models.


Jenny is new to coding and has an interest in data science and machine learning and has no real experience in any of these.
doesnt know what she doesnt know
doesnt know where to start looking


Jennifer has several years experience of R and Python (and occasionally wrangled a few C++ libraries)
Jennifer is curious about Clojure because ???
- listened to a talk on Simple made Easy and wishes that R and Python would make some of the work simpler
