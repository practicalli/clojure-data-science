# Clojure Data Science tooling: Notebooks

Notebooks are interactive documents that include executable code and its results.  They are a form of literate programming.

For over 30 years data scientists have used notebooks for experiments, exploration of data and communicating insights to other data scientist and businesses.

Software engineers can also use notebooks for development, providing fast feedback and a consistent way to visualise data.

Open source notebooks include Jupyter (formerly known as iPython) and Apache Zeppelin.

Hosted offerings include Deepnote, Noteable, Databricks Collaborative Notebooks, Google Colab, Jovian.ml, among others.

Notebooks are programming language specific or support code for multiple languages like Polynote.

> #### Hint::Wolfram Mathematica - first computational notebook
> On June 23 1988 Stephan Wolfram first released [Wolfram Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_Mathematica) that allow machine learning, statistics, symbolic computation, manipulating matrices, plotting functions and various types of data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other programming languages.
