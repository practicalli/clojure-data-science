# Data Science with Clojure

Getting started with Clojure data science applications libraries and tools.  Learn to write services and applications using Clojure  within the context of data science.

Introduces Clojure libraries and tools useful for creating notebooks, applications, services and visualizations

## What is data science

Neural networks are a collection of predicate functions that are assembled into a network

AI is the future we are trying to build
machine learning, neural networks, natural language programming are the practical tools and approaches that we are applying to solve AI


## What is Clojure?
Clojure is a general purpose programming language and is used for creating any applications, tools, services across any industry.

Clojure is a hosted language, so it can run on a Java Virtual machine (especially for high volume data processing).  Clojure can also run on JavaScript engines found in web browsers and nodejs.

Clojure has a very simple syntax and is simple to write and maintain.

Clojure is very data centric and the standard library has over 500 functions for manipulating and transforming data, so is ideal for data science tasks.

[Practicalli Clojure will help you get started with Clojure](https://practicalli.github.io/clojure/) and help you create a Clojure development environment with a [Clojure aware editor](http://practicalli.github.io/clojure/clojure-editors/).

## Aspects to develop for the book
* Aspects of data science and
* Visualization of data
* Integration with other data science tooling
* Reference to useful mathematical techniques

This guide will not teach you how to be a professional data scientist but should help you when working with experienced data scientists.
