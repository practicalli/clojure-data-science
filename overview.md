# Overview



# Data Science with Clojure
A guide to writing services and applications in the context of data science

Introduces libraries and tools useful for creating those applications

Visualisation of data

Integration with other data science tooling

Reference to useful mathematical techniques

This guide does not claim to make any attempt to teach you how to be a professional data scientist.


## Initial focus
Focusing on the essentials as a very basic introduction to some of the most simplest data science

* tools
* data wrangling
* data visualisation


## Example projects

* Simple Covid19 dashboard - import data from CSV, simple data wrangling and creating a website dashboard using Oz for a vega-lite based visualisation and CSS for highlighting specific data points

* Oz Visualisation examples - learn some of the capabilities of Oz and demonstrate how to create a range of visualisations

* Ascii visualisation

* Visualising survey data - take a survey such as


## Other aspects

* Data generation - examples of how to generate sample data

* Data sources - what are good data sources and what concepts are they good for exploring

* Identify and simply explain data science concepts and provide understanding / examples of how they can be valuable


## Data Science

> #### TODO::work in progress, sorry

What does it include and what kind of projects


- Trend analysis
- Principle component analysis
- Basic Modelling (for machine learning)


### Data Mining
* scraping unstructured data sources
* consuming open API data sources
* highlighting reputable and high quality data sources


## Clojure libraries for data science
* Tablecloth
* dtype-next
* tech.viz
* Oz
* Hanami


## Time series
* [tidyverts](https://tidyverts.org/)



## Contributing
Issues and pull requests are most welcome.  Please detail issues as much as you can.  Pull requests are easier when they are specific to a page or at most a section.  The smaller the change the quicker it is to review and merge.
