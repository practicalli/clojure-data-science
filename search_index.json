Alpha stage bookOver 3 months of work has been planned out for the development of this book.  If funding via Clojurists Together is secured, then this work will be completed before the end of 2021.  Otherwise the first release of the book will be Spring/Summer 2022\nA practical guide to data mining, data wrangling and visualisation tools, techniques and libraries.  Guides will take a story telling approach to ensure a meaningful context in which design decisions are taken.\nA starting point for Clojure developers on their journey into Data Science.  As Data Science is such a vast subject area, no one resource can cover such diversity, so this guide will recommend numerous resources that go far deeper into specific areas.\nTarget Audience\nThis guide is aimed at software engineers interested in data science or working as data analysts or with data science teams.  No data science experience is expected and the authors of this guide are not data science experts.\nMathematics concepts underpin much of data science and will be explained as they are used, or recommend resources linked to.  Mathematics experience should also notbe required.\nSciCloj community\nA community of people using Clojure and other tools to create amazing things in the realm of science\n\nHomepage\nYouTube channel\nGitHub repository\nSciCloj discussions on Zulip Clojurians\n\nResources\n\nInteractive Programming for Artificial Intelligence - learn artificial intelligence programming skills\ndragan.rocks - articles on data science with Clojure\nclojuredatascience.com - Henry Garner\n\nAspects to develop for the book\n\nAspects of data science and\nVisualization of data\nIntegration with other data science tooling\nReference to useful mathematical techniques\n\nThis guide will not teach you how to be a professional data scientist but should help you when working with experienced data scientists.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 ShareAlike License (including images & stylesheets).\nData Science, Practicalli by John Stevenson is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.Based on a work at Data Science, Practicalli on Gitub.Permissions beyond the scope of this license may be available at @practical_li.\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"overview.html":{"url":"overview.html","title":"Overview","keywords":"","body":"Overview\nData Science with Clojure\nA guide to writing services and applications in the context of data science\nIntroduces libraries and tools useful for creating those applications\nVisualisation of data\nIntegration with other data science tooling\nReference to useful mathematical techniques\nThis guide does not claim to make any attempt to teach you how to be a professional data scientist.\nInitial focus\nFocusing on the essentials as a very basic introduction to some of the most simplest data science\n\ntools\ndata wrangling\ndata visualisation\n\nExample projects\n\nSimple Covid19 dashboard - import data from CSV, simple data wrangling and creating a website dashboard using Oz for a vega-lite based visualisation and CSS for highlighting specific data points\nOz Visualisation examples - learn some of the capabilities of Oz and demonstrate how to create a range of visualisations\nAscii visualisation\nVisualising survey data - take a survey such as\n\nOther aspects\n\nData generation - examples of how to generate sample data\nData sources - what are good data sources and what concepts are they good for exploring\nIdentify and simply explain data science concepts and provide understanding / examples of how they can be valuable\n\nData Science\n work in progress, sorry\nWhat does it include and what kind of projects\n\nTrend analysis\nPrinciple component analysis\nBasic Modelling (for machine learning)\n\nData Mining\n\nscraping unstructured data sources\nconsuming open API data sources\nhighlighting reputable and high quality data sources\n\nClojure libraries for data science\n\nTablecloth\ndtype-next\ntech.viz\nOz\nHanami\n\nTime series\n\ntidyverts\n\nContributing\nIssues and pull requests are most welcome.

This installs clojure command system wide (/usr/local/bin/) along with the clj wapper that runs a terminal REPL using rlwrap (TODO: check rlwrap is installed).\nUse a range of community tools by installing the practicalli/clojure-deps-edn configuration (first deleting the ~/.clojure directory if it exists - create if you run clojure or clj for the first time)\ngit clone https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-deps-edn.git ~/.clojure/\n\nNew projects can be created on the remote server, using one of the numerous project templates for Clojure projects.

Emacs CIDER, VSCode Calva and NeoVim Conjure all use nREPL and the Cider middleware.\nThe :middleware/cider-clj will inject the nREPL and Cider middleware libraries.\nSSH into the remote server.\nChange to a Clojure project\nStart the REPL using the cider middleware on the same port as defined in LocalForward in the SSH configuration, using the -p to set the port number.\nclojure -M:middleware/cider-clj -p 1234\n\nConfigure Emacs to listen to nREPL port\nEmacs can be used to connect to a running Clojure project that has been run with the nREPL and Cider middleware, e.g. :middleware/cider-clj from practicalli/clojure-deps-edn\nEdit your Emacs ~/.emacs.d/init.el file and add the following configuration.\nFor Spacemacs, edit ~/.spacemacs and add the following code to dotspacemacs/user-config\n(setq nrepl-use-ssh-fallback-for-remote-hosts t)\n\nUsing NeoVim and Conjure on remote server\nNeoVim and Conjure are installed on the remote server using the Practicalli install guide.\nConjure will automatically connect to a running REPL\n Conjure uses .nrepl-portConjure looks for the .nrepl-port in the root of the project.  If this file is not created when running the REPL, create the file and use the same value as LocalForward from the SSH configuration.\nApache HTTPd server as a reverse proxy\nUse a reverse proxy if you wish to expose visualizations via a browser, such as Oz or notespace.\nssh into the remote server with an account that has sudo privileges\nEnable the reverse proxy module mod_proxy_http which has a dependency on mod_proxy and is also enabled automatically.\nsudo a2enmod proxy_http\n\n Modules are part of the Ubuntu Apache installNo additional Ubuntu packages are required, as these modules are already part of the Apache2 package install.\nCreate a new configuration by copying the /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf to /etc/apache2/sites-available/reverse-proxy.conf.  This ensures you have a working backup if the configuration breaks or you wish to quickly switch back to a non-proxy configuration.\nEdit /etc/apache2/sites-available/reverse-proxy.conf and add the following configuration inside the VirtualHost directive\nProxyRequests Off\n     ProxyPass \"/\" \"http://localhost:8080/\"\n     ProxyPassReverse \"/\" \"http://localhost:8080/\"\n\nsudo a2ensite reverse-proxy to enable the reverse-proxy configuration, which adds a symbolic link in the /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/ directory (all configurations in this directory are included via /etc/apache2/apache2.conf)\nDisable the other sites so that they do not over-ride the reverse proxy configuraion.  This simply removes the symbolic link from sites-enabled directory, their configuration is still in the sites-available directory.\nsudo a2dissite scicloj\nsudo a2dissite 000-default\n\nsudo systemctl restart apache2 to restart apache http server with the reverse proxy configuration\nTo use a number of projects or visualisation tools, update the /etc/apache2/sites-available/reverse-proxy.conf and add more ProxyPass and ProxyReverse directives\nProxyPass \"/oz\" \"http://localhost:8080/\"\n     ProxyPassReverse \"/oz\" \"http://localhost:8080/\"\n\n     ProxyPass \"/notespace\" \"http://localhost:8181/\"\n     ProxyPassReverse \"/notespace\" \"http://localhost:8181/\"\n\n Oz only working on /Using the reverse proxy configuration so far, Oz will only render the server page and not the views.  It is assumed that this is because of web sockets and will need to enable the mod proxy module for websockets too.References\nhttps://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy_wstunnel.html\nhttps://www.serverlab.ca/tutorials/linux/web-servers-linux/how-to-reverse-proxy-websockets-with-apache-2-4/\nhttps://websiteforstudents.com/configure-reverse-proxies-using-apache2-http-server-on-ubuntu-18-04/\n\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"reference/":{"url":"reference/","title":"Reference","keywords":"","body":"Reference\nTerminology, useful background information and external links.\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"reference/math/math-for-clojure-developers.html":{"url":"reference/math/math-for-clojure-developers.html","title":"Math for Clojure developers","keywords":"","body":"Math For Clojure Developers\n\nMath for Clojurists\n\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "}}}
